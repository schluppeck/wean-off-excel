## Using Rstudio in the cloud

You can use a google or github account to sign up for a free RStudio account
and try things out through a web browser.


## Getting R and Rstudio on your computer

The Open Source version of ``RStudio Desktop`` is a really excellent interface
for working with `R``. [This
page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) has download
instructions for the program.

You will also have to [download ``R``](https://cran.rstudio.com/) itself from a
slightly different place.

Both these work on all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, and
Linux.

## Getting this code

- either download the zip file or use ``git clone`` to grab the whole
  repository of code.
